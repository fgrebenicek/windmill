# WindMill -- 3D Model

3D model of real windmill replica in Jalub√≠ (Czech Republic).

* Modeling application: OpenSCAD, see [openscad.org](http://www.openscad.org/)
* Original replica: see [jalubi.eu](http://www.jalubi.eu/informace-o-obci/historie-vetrneho-mlyna/)

## Expected Workflow

1. Take photos of real windmill and transform them to given scale. (Done)
2. Create plain 3D model in OpenSCAD. (Almost done)
3. Export all parts of model to STL format.
4. Import all parts to Blender. Possibly do small adjustements and apply textures.
5. Export paper models from Blender using [Paper Model Plugin](https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Import-Export/Paper_Model) to SVG.
6. Finalize paper model in Inkscape and export to PDF.
